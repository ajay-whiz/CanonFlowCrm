### Example API Usage

```typescript
import { apiClient } from '../lib/api'

// Login
const response = await apiClient.login({
  email: 'admin@example.com',
  password: 'yourpassword123'
})

// Get leads
const leads = await apiClient.getLeads()

// Create lead
const newLead = await apiClient.createLead({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  phone: '+1234567890',
  company: 'Acme Corp',
  status: 'new'
})
```

## Responsive Design

## Customization

### Theming

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: {
        // Your primary colors
      },
      secondary: {
        // Your secondary colors
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Features

2. Add API endpoints to `lib/api.ts`
3. Create custom hooks for data management
4. Add routes to the app directory
